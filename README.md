* Scheduled mode: Same functionality as manual mode, however it will start pinning on certain time/date. 
* Autopilot mode will automatically Scrape and Pin query/niche relevant pins to your selected boards. Simply type in all queries/categories for each board and PinBot will do its thing.
* Repin niche relevant pins onto your boards. It’s easy as one, two, three. In the manual mode you’ll have to “Keep”/”Skip” the pins. While in autopilot the PinBot’s algorithm will do that. Just select your boards and write all the queries/categories to search in for pins.
* Like niche relevant pins from other users. 
* Create and invite to your Group Boards. This will invite all your board’s followers to also pin on your boards. Let other people do all the hard work for you, focus on creating new accounts instead! Select all boards and it will attempt to invite all followers onto that board.
* Follow Pinterest users and get follow backs. The settings and internal algorithm provide quality guarantee users. Filter out all the non-legit users, bots and selfish users!
